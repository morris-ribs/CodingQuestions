# Sparse Array

You have a large array with most of the elements as zero.

Use a more space-efficient data structure, SparseArray, that implements the same interface:

- _init(arr, size)_: initialize with the original large array and size.
- _set(i, val)_: updates index at i with val.
- _get(i)_: gets the value at index i.
