# Hit Counter

Design and implement a HitCounter class that keeps track of requests (or hits). It should support the following operations:

- _record(timestamp)_: records a hit that happened at timestamp
- _total()_: returns the total number of hits recorded
- _range(lower, upper)_: returns the number of hits that occurred between timestamps lower and upper (inclusive)
