# Stack through Heap

Implement a stack API using only a heap. A stack implements the following methods:

- _push(item)_, which adds an element to the stack
- _pop()_, which removes and returns the most recently added element (or throws an error if there is nothing on the stack)

Recall that a heap has the following operations:

- _push(item)_, which adds a new key to the heap
- _pop()_, which removes and returns the max value of the heap
